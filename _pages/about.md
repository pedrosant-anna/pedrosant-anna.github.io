I am a PhD student in economics at MIT. I hold an MSc in economics from the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics. I am interested in topics in applied microeconomics, particularly those related to behavioral economics and political economy. In my current research, I use field experiments and other applied methods to study topics related to political economy, social identity, and discrimination.

You can find my complete CV [here](/cv), and take a look at my research [here](/research).
